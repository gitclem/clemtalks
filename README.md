# Clem's Talks on Data Science, Machine Learning

Varkious Jupyter Notebooks of talks on that I have given.

## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
* python
* Jupyter Notebooks
* R
* R Studio (someday)



### Installing

Look elsewhere to installing Python (probably 3), Jupyter Notebooks, etc.

### GitHub

This fixes the problem `fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly`.

`config http.postBuffer 52428800`

###

* I store the Jupyter Notebook with the cells cleared because the doing versioning with the values in the cells is a nuisance.  This is because a slight change in the notebook will make it seem a lot more has changed than it really has.
* I store a PDF version of the Notebook, in case it's too hard for a person to download everything and to get it to work
